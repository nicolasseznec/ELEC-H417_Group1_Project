# ELEC-H417_Group1_Project

This project consists in designing a peer to peer TOR network, able to admit and manage a variable number of peers, and allow those peers to anonymously send requests to a server.

The required libraries are in the requirement.txt. 
Their installation can be easily with pip.
For example:
``pip install pycryptodome ``

Every node of the network is instantiated with the creation of a **Node** object
